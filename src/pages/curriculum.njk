                    This was the question we posed to ourselves as we developed
                    Techlabâ€™s curriculum. We leaned on several years of
                    experience teaching students. We conducted in-depth research
                    with experts in education and reviewed the

                    For Tynkerers (typically grade 5, 6, 7), the class content
                    develops understanding around how computers work, nurturing
                    logical and flow-based instructions using pseudo code and
                    then develop this foundation further by designing
                    interactive games in Python. The learning continues with
                    design skills and creating a mobile app and a web site, and
                    enhanced learning and tinkering through Arduino projects
                    that use hardware and sensors.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Explorer</h5>
                  <p class="card-text text-secondary">
                    For Intermediate learners (typically grades 6, 7 & 8), we
                    dive deeper into Internet, data, and design concepts. Kids
                    develop their own website in HTML/Javascript, use styling
                    using a templating framework, develop visualizations and
                    games in Python. We then go deeper in the concepts of
                    programming and problem solving using Python. The curriculum
                    also includes learning sensors and camera using Raspberry
                    Pi, which the kids control through the internet using their
                    own hosted website.

                    in their high school years and deep dives into
                    object-oriented programming in Java. We also develop AI/ML
                    understanding using advanced python packages amd encourage
                    students to build portfolio engineering and code projects.
                    The projects combine design (web, mobile), advanced coding,
                    maker and entrepreneurship skills for science fairs,
                    internships, hackathons, or building one's own dream
