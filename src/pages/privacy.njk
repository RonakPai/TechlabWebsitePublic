            This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are
            concerned with how their Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
            is being used by Techlab Education (the Company). PII, as used in US
            privacy law and information security, is information that can be
            used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or
            locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.
            Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear
            understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle
            your Personally Identifiable Information in this Service.

            What personal information do we collect?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We opt to collect the minimum amount of Personally Identifiable
            Information possible.
          </p>
          <ol style="list-style: disc; color: #7b7b7b" type="disc">
            <li>
              For guest users, we do not require any personally identifiable
              information.
            </li>
            <li>
              For users that create an account with an email account, or by
              linking an external authentication provider like Google, Facebook,
              or Twitter, we only collect full names and email address.
            </li>
            <li>
              For student accounts, we do not require any personally
              identifiable information, and encourage teachers to avoid naming
              students with personally identifiable information.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            We provide users a way to access our applications as a guest user,
            where they are not asked for any Personally Identifying Information.
            A user may opt to create an account with their email address, at
            which time they will also be prompted for their name. Student
            accounts only have a name attached to them, and are not visible to
            anyone but the authenticated teacher account that created them.
            Student names are not required to be the full or accurate name of a
            student, and teachers can always opt to name their students
            according to any naming scheme.
          </p>
          <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">
            When do we collect information?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We collect detailed analytics on user activity through an analytics
            service, but this information is anonymized. We also collect
            information about email addresses and names during the account
            creation process, and store it using strong encryption to prevent
            unauthorized access.
          </p>
          <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">
            How do we use your information?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use the information we collect to send transaction emails,
            welcome emails, and in the case of student accounts, login to our
            service. We provide an easy opt-out procedure from your user
            account. We never disclose any Personally Identifiable Information
            to a third party.
          </p>
          <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">
            How do we protect visitor information?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We only provide articles and information. We never ask for personal
            or private information like your name, email address, or credit card
            numbers, to access any part of the site. You may voluntarily submit
            your email address to us for the aforementioned purpose of periodic
            emails, but we do not require your email for any part of our
            website. When we collect your email, it is securely stored in a
            third-party email list management service, and never shared with any
            third party.
          </p>
          <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">
            Do we use cookies?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use cookies only to identify your session on our website with a

            Third-party disclosure
          </h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your
            personally identifiable information. This does not include website
            hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our
            website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as
            those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may
            also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply
            with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others'
            rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable
            visitor information (e.g. usage numbers, total number of users) may
            be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other
            uses.

            Third-party links
          </h2>
          <p>
            Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party
            products or services on our website. These third-party sites have
            separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no
            responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these
            linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our
            site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

            California Online Privacy Protection Act
          </h2>
          <p>
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
            websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's
            reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or
            company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
            operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
            from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on
            its website stating exactly the information being collected and
            those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with
            this policy.

          </p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold; margin:0px;">
            According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
          </p>
          <ol style="list-style: disc; color: #7b7b7b" type="disc">
            <li>

            <li>
              Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on
              our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after
              entering our website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our Privacy Policy link includes the word "Privacy" and can be

            How does our site handle do not track signals?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or
            use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in
            place.

            Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking
          </h2>
          <p>
            It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party
            behavioral tracking.

          <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">
            COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
          </h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from
            children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
            (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the
            nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
            spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
            protect children's privacy and safety online.
            <br />
            <br />
            The COPPA Rule requires the Service to obtain clear and verifiable
            parental consent before receiving personal information from children
            under 13. We rely on educators to obtain and provide appropriate
            consent, if needed, to collect student information, or make the
            decision to avoid using personally identifiable information. By
            providing personally identifiable information for students under 13
            years old, you hereby represent and warrant that you have the full
            authority and rights to provide such information on your student's
            behalf, and provided appropriate disclosure to students and their
            parents for sharing the student's information with us.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are a child under the age of 13, we require the consent of
            your parents or legal guardian prior to you using the Service, and
            may not be able to access all features of the Service until you have
            parental consent.

          <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">
            Fair Information Practices
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
            privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
            played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
            around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
            Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
            with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
          </p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold; margin:0px;">
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
            the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
          </p>
          <ol style="list-style: disc; color: #7b7b7b" type="disc">
            <li>
              We will notify the users via email within 1 business day.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1
              business day.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires
            that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights
            against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
            law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
            enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
            have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
            prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
          </p>
          <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">CAN SPAM Act</h2>
          <p>
            The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
            establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients
            the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells
            out tough penalties for violations.
          </p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future
            emails, you can click the "Unsubscribe" link in any email and we
            will immediately remove you from all future correspondence.
