              What is Techlab's Teaching Philosophy?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our core teaching philosophy focuses on nurturing learning in kids
              through self motivation and hands-on project work in small-size
              online experiences. We apply decades of real world professional
              experience in Silicon Valley and combine it with research in the
              science of learning. We have a well defined and rigorously
              developed curriculum to achieve outcomes working with students.

            <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">
              Will online camps follow the same curriculum as previous summer camps?
            </h4>
            <p>
            Yes, techlab online camps leverage the same content, tutor instructions, and best practices for 
            student learning we have used for the last 7+ years. 
            </p>
            <br/>

            <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">
              What is your student to instructor ratio for online camps?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Typically we have 6-8 students per instructor. In some sessions the
              instructor may include a teaching assistant to help with coding or
              engineering projects.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">
              Who are your instructors and teaching assistants?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our instructors are working professionals at high-tech
              companies(incl. Google, Intel, Oracle) and college students with
              Computer and engineering majors. Our staff is trained and we
              emphasize paying attention to each student's individualized
              learning needs. We also include teaching assistants in a few
              classes to assist instructors.

 <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">
              What are best practices for students to attend online camps from home?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our team has done extensive research to find out what works best for your student. Here are our recommendations:
              <li> Make sure your student is in a quiet environment, preferably his/her own space or room with minimal distractions from TV, parents, siblings, pets.
              </li>
              <li> Make sure the student has a comfortable desk/chair setup </li>
              <li> Make sure the studentâ€™s computer (desktop/laptop) is easily accessible and ready to go</li>
              <li> When instructors ask them to share their work they should be prepared to share their screen and collaborate</li>
              <li> Plan ahead, students may have to download software (one-time only) depending on the class they are enrolled in</li>
              <li> We recommend the student does not eat/drink at the table (if possible). This can lead to spillage and/or unneeded distractions for the student.
              </li>
              <li> Ensure the lighting and temperature in the room is comfortable for the student to create a relaxed, 
              engaging and fun environment </li>

              How will the kids be engaged for half day and full day online camp sessions?
            </h4>
            <p>
              To keep the kids engaged we will be planning various activities, including 
brain teasers, puzzles, card IQ games, online pictionary, other, during frequent breaks. 
The students will have the option to participate w/ their fellow campers during these breaks. Our 
trained instructors will also participate, and moderate as needed.

              How about lunch break or snack breaks during online camps?
            </h4>
            <p>
              We will have a planned lunch session from 12-1pm, and students will
               be given snack breaks during morning and afternoon sessions.

              Do you provide year around programs?

              long after-school classes for grades 6 through high school.

              Can we continue with sessions after summer camps?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our focus is to ensure continued learning through practice to
              grasp the fundamentals and build on skills. Our Fall and Spring
              sessions focus on school year learning. For our students, we offer
              a complementary evaluation session, to match learning tracks with
              student's knowledge and needs. Please email us at

            </h4>
            <p>
              We believe kids learn best when they are in a group environment

              more student enrolling together.

              What is your policy for missed classes?
            </h4>
            <p>
              For summer camps, please inquire with your instructor for missed classes. 
              Our summer camps are fast paced and we will try our best to work with your student to 
              make up for missed day/s. </p>

<p>
              For Fall/spring classes held once a week, if a student is going to miss her
              scheduled time, she can attend another class date offered during
              the same week, e.g. if Intro to Java student misses regular
              Tuesday (5-6.30p) class, she can attend the Sat (10.30-noon)
              class, by informing her instructor. For classes held twice a week,
              for missed class/es, the instructor will work with you to makeup
              and stay in sync with the class schedule.<a
